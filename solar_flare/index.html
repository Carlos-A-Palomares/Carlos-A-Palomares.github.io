        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Solar flares are sudden, intense bursts of radiation emanating from the Sun's atmosphere. These powerful eruptions occur when magnetic energy built up in the Sun's atmosphere is suddenly released. They are often associated with sunspots, which are cooler regions on the Sun's surface with intense magnetic activity. Solar flares can produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from radio waves to X-rays and gamma rays. They can significantly impact space weather, affecting satellite operations, GPS signals, and radio communications on Earth. Solar flares are classified into five categories: A, B, C, M, and X, with X being the most intense. Each class is ten times more powerful than the previous one, with X-class flares capable of causing widespread disruptions. The radiation from solar flares can also pose risks to astronauts and high-altitude flight crews. Despite their potential for disruption, solar flares are a natural part of the Sun's 11-year solar cycle. Scientists study solar flares to better understand their mechanisms and to improve space weather forecasting, which can help mitigate their effects on technology and human activities.

                <h3>Solar Flare Classification</h3>
                <p>Solar flares are classified based on their intensity. The classes are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>X-Class:</strong> Major flares that can cause worldwide radio blackouts and long-lasting radiation storms.</li>
                    <li><strong>M-Class:</strong> Medium-sized flares that can cause brief radio blackouts affecting Earthâ€™s polar regions.</li>
                    <li><strong>C-Class:</strong> Small flares with few noticeable consequences on Earth.</li>
                    <li><strong>B-Class and A-Class:</strong> Minor flares with minimal impact on Earth.</li>
                </ul>
