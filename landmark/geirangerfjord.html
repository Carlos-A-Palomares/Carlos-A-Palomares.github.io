    <h1>Geirangerfjord, Stranda, Norway</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Geirangerfjord, located in the Stranda Municipality in the MÃ¸re og Romsdal county of Norway, is one of the most picturesque and famous fjords in the world. This stunning UNESCO World Heritage site is renowned for its breathtaking scenery, which includes towering cliffs, lush greenery, and cascading waterfalls such as the Seven Sisters and the Suitor, both of which are visible from the fjord's crystal-clear waters. Geirangerfjord is approximately 15 kilometers long and is surrounded by some of the steepest mountains on the west coast of Norway, making it a popular location for scenic boat tours that offer views of abandoned farms clinging to cliff sides and wildlife in its natural habitat.</p>
