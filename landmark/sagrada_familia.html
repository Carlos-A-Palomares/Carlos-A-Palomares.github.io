    <h1>Sagrada Familia, Barcelona, Spain</h1>
    
    <p>Sagrada Familia is a monumental Roman Catholic basilica in Barcelona, Spain, designed by the celebrated architect Antoni Gaudí. Construction began in 1882 and the building remains famously unfinished, with completion projected for 2026. Its architecture is a stunning blend of Gothic and Art Nouveau forms, featuring elaborate facades and expansive interiors lined with columns that mimic trees and branches, creating a forest-like atmosphere. The basilica is adorned with Christian symbolism and intricate details that embody Gaudí’s deep religious faith and his love for Catalonia’s natural landscapes. Sagrada Familia is not only a work of architectural genius but also a symbol of Barcelona’s cultural identity.</p>
