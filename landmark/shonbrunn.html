    <h1>Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna, Austria</h1>
    
    <p>Schönbrunn Palace, situated in Vienna, Austria, is one of the most important architectural, cultural, and historical monuments in the country. Originally built as a hunting lodge, it was transformed into the magnificent Baroque palace we see today during the reign of Empress Maria Theresa in the 18th century. Schönbrunn, with its 1,441 rooms, was the summer residence of the Habsburg rulers. The palace is renowned for its beautifully manicured gardens, the Gloriette monument, the Palm House, and the world’s oldest continuously operating zoo. Schönbrunn is not only a major tourist attraction but also a symbol of the power and influence of the Habsburg monarchy.</p>
