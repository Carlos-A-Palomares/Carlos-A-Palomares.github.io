    <h1>Alhambra, Granada, Spain</h1>
    <div class="centered-text">
        <p>The Alhambra is a stunning historical palace and fortress complex located in Granada, Spain. Constructed mainly during the mid-13th century to the end of the 14th century under the Nasrid dynasty, it represents one of the finest examples of Islamic art and architecture in Europe. The Alhambra stands out for its intricate decorations, including arabesques, calligraphy, and finely crafted tilework, all of which exemplify the artistic creativity of the Moors during the last centuries of their rule in Spain. Its name, derived from the Arabic 'Al-Qalaâ€™a Al-Hamra' meaning 'The Red Castle', refers to the red-toned walls and towers that encircle this hilltop fortress. Overlooking the city of Granada, the Alhambra also features expansive courtyards and lush gardens, such as the Generalife, the summer palace with its famous fountains and greenery. Today, the Alhambra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors from around the world who come to marvel at its beauty and delve into its rich history.</p>
