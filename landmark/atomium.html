        <p>The Atomium, located in Brussels, Belgium, is an iconic structure that was originally constructed for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair (Expo 58). Designed by engineer André Waterkeyn and architects André and Jean Polak, it stands 102 meters tall and represents an iron crystal magnified 165 billion times. Comprising nine stainless steel spheres connected by tubes, the Atomium is arranged in the shape of a body-centered cubic crystal lattice. Each sphere has a diameter of 18 meters, and they are linked in such a way that visitors can walk through the connecting tubes, which contain escalators and exhibit halls. This remarkable design symbolizes the atomic age and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Today, the Atomium serves not only as a museum but also as a powerful symbol of modern architecture and scientific progress. It offers panoramic views of Brussels and hosts various exhibitions related to science, design, and society.</p>
