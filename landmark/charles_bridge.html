        <p>Charles Bridge is a historic stone Gothic bridge that crosses the Vltava river in Prague, Czech Republic. Commissioned by King Charles IV and constructed by architect Petr Parléř in 1357, it was the only means of crossing the river in Prague until 1841. This made it a crucial connection between Prague Castle and the city's Old Town and adjacent areas. Notably, its construction was initiated with the laying of the first stone by the Holy Roman Emperor himself at precisely 5:31 AM on July 9, 1357, a time believed to be chosen by royal astrologers to create a numerically significant sequence (1-3-5-7-9-7-5-3-1) that would imbue the bridge with additional strength. The bridge is famed for its alignment of 30 baroque statues of religious figures erected around 1700 but now replaced by replicas, with the originals preserved in the National Museum. Today, Charles Bridge is a pedestrian zone and one of Prague's most significant attractions, renowned for its bustling atmosphere of artists, musicians, and vendors, alongside its breathtaking views of the Prague skyline.</p>
