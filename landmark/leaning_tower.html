    <h1>Leaning Tower of Pisa, Pisa, Italy</h1>
    <div>
        <p> The Leaning Tower of Pisa, officially known as the bell tower of the Pisa Cathedral, is a freestanding bell tower located in the city of Pisa, Italy. Famous for its unintended tilt, the tower began to lean to the southeast soon after the onset of construction in 1173 due to a poorly laid foundation and soft ground that could not properly support the structure's weight. The tower's lean has become its most famous feature, making it one of the most recognized and photographed buildings in the world Standing at approximately 56 meters (183.7 feet) from the ground on the low side and 57 meters (186.7 feet) on the high side, the tower has 294 steps leading to the top. Despite ongoing efforts to stabilize the structure and reduce the tilt, it continues to draw visitors from around the world. Architecturally, it is notable for its Romanesque style, characterized by ornate columns and arches, and it serves as the campanile, or bell tower, for the nearby cathedral. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is part of a complex of buildings that make up the Piazza dei Miracoli (Square of Miracles), which also includes the Pisa Cathedral, the Pisa Baptistry, and the Camposanto Monumentale (Monumental Cemetery). This site has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its outstanding medieval art and architecture. Visitors to the Leaning Tower can climb its spiraling staircase for a view that overlooks the city and the other architectural marvels on the square.</p>
