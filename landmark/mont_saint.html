    <p>Mont Saint-Michel is a small rocky island located in Normandy, France, renowned for its medieval Benedictine Abbey and steepled church, which occupy most of the 1-square-kilometer island. Connected to the mainland via a narrow causeway, the architectural marvel appears to rise from the sea at high tide. Originally founded as a sanctuary in honor of the Archangel Michael in the 8th century, the abbey symbolizes the strength and resilience of medieval Christian devotion. Over centuries, it has been a strategic fortification, a place of pilgrimage, and a bastion of learning. Today, Mont Saint-Michel is a UNESCO World Heritage site and attracts millions of visitors who are captivated by its beauty and historical significance.</p>
