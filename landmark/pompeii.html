    <h1>Pompeii, Naples, Italy</h1>
    <p>Pompeii, located near Naples, Italy, is an ancient Roman city that was tragically frozen in time due to the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The volcanic ash and pumice preserved the city in extraordinary detail, providing a poignant glimpse into daily life in the Roman Empire. Excavations have revealed richly decorated homes, complex streets, and vivid frescoes that tell stories of the prosperous city. Pompeii now serves as a significant archaeological site and a sobering reminder of natureâ€™s power, drawing scholars and tourists alike to explore its ruins and museums.</p>
