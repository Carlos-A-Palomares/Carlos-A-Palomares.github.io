        <p>The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and one of the most remarkable architectural and engineering achievements of the ancient world. Located in the center of Rome, Italy, it was constructed under the Flavian emperors, beginning with Vespasian in AD 72 and completed in AD 80 by his son Titus. Additional modifications were made during the reign of Domitian. Originally, this enormous stone and concrete structure could hold between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators, making it the largest amphitheater ever built in the Roman Empire. It was primarily used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The Colosseum remains a popular tourist destination, as well as a potent symbol of Rome's enduring history. It has also become a monument to the resilience of the Roman architectural form, surviving through earthquakes and stone-robbers to remain a dominant landmark in the modern cityscape.</p>
