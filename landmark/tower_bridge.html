    <p>Tower Bridge, an iconic symbol of London, was constructed in 1894 and is a combined bascule and suspension bridge over the River Thames. It is adjacent to the Tower of London, from which it derives its name, and has become one of the cityâ€™s most recognizable landmarks. The bridge's distinctive Victorian Gothic style was designed to harmonize with the nearby Tower of London. It features two tower turrets connected at the upper level by two walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge. The walkways offer visitors stunning panoramic views of the city and are part of exhibits that explore the engineering and history of the bridge.</p>
