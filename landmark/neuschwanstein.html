    <h1>Neuschwanstein Castle, Bavaria, Germany</h1>
    
    <p>Neuschwanstein Castle, located in Bavaria, Germany, is one of the most famous and picturesque castles in the world. Commissioned by Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and homage to Richard Wagner, the castle was constructed in the late 19th century. Though never completed, Neuschwanstein embodies the essence of Romanticism, with its fairy-tale architecture inspiring Disney’s Sleeping Beauty Castle. Set against the rugged backdrop of the Alps, its towers and fortifications blend with the scenic landscape, drawing millions of visitors each year. Neuschwanstein also represents Ludwig’s obsession with medieval myths and his desire to create a personal sanctuary of beauty and isolation.</p>
