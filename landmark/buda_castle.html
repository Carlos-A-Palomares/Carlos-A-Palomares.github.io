        <p>Buda Castle, perched majestically on Castle Hill overlooking the city of Budapest, Hungary, is a historical palace complex of the Hungarian kings. Dating back to 1265, when the first castle was built on this site, the current grand structure has evolved through many reconstructions, most notably during the 18th century under the Habsburg monarchy. It is known for its Baroque architecture, although remnants of earlier medieval and Renaissance styles are still visible in parts of the complex. The castle complex includes the Hungarian National Gallery and the Budapest History Museum, which showcase Hungary's artistic and historical artifacts. Buda Castle is not only a national symbol but also a UNESCO World Heritage site, recognized for its historical importance and architectural beauty. It offers stunning views of Budapest, including the iconic Chain Bridge and the Danube River, making it a key attraction for visitors from around the world.</p>
