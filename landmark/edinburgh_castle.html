        <p>Edinburgh Castle is a historic fortress that dominates the skyline of Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, from its position atop Castle Rock. Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age (2nd century AD), although the nature of the early settlement is unclear. The castle itself has been involved in numerous historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite Rising in 1745. It has been besieged both successfully and unsuccessfully more than any other place in Britain.</p>
        <p>Today, Edinburgh Castle is one of the most visited and recognizable landmarks in Scotland. It houses the Honours (Crown Jewels) of Scotland, the Stone of Destiny (used in the coronation of Scottish rulers), the famous 15th-century gun Mons Meg, the One O' Clock Gun, and the National War Museum of Scotland. Its strategic location offers panoramic views of the city, making it a favorite spot for photographs and sightseeing. The castle's rich history and dramatic architectural presence continue to make it a key symbol of Scottish heritage and a pivotal part of Edinburgh's World Heritage Site designation.</p>
