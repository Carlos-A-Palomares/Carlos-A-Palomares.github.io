    <h1>Saint Basil’s Cathedral, Moscow, Russia</h1>
    
    <p>Saint Basil’s Cathedral, officially known as the Cathedral of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos on the Moat, is located in the heart of Moscow, Russia. Constructed from 1555 to 1561 under the orders of Ivan the Terrible, it commemorates the capture of Kazan and Astrakhan, marking the geographical and spiritual conquests of his reign. The cathedral is famous for its vivid, onion-shaped domes and bright, patterned colors that draw inspiration from the flames of a bonfire. This architectural icon stands in the Red Square and is often mistaken as the Kremlin. However, its distinctive design sets it apart as a masterpiece of Russian architecture, symbolizing the unique cultural heritage of the country.</p>
