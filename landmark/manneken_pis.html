    <p>Manneken Pis, often called the Peeing Boy, is a small bronze fountain sculpture in Brussels, Belgium, depicting a naked little boy urinating into the fountain's basin. Situated near the Grand Place in Brussels, the statue is a famous landmark and symbol of the city's irreverent sense of humor. Originally designed by HiÃ«ronymus Duquesnoy the Elder and put in place in 1618 or 1619, the sculpture has become one of Brussels' most famous and beloved icons.

        Despite its modest size, standing only 61 centimeters tall, Manneken Pis plays a significant role in Brussels' folklore, frequently dressed in costumes according to a published schedule which runs several times a week. The statue's wardrobe consists of several hundred different outfits, reflecting various international costumes, professions, and causes. Over the years, it has been the subject of numerous thefts but always restored or replaced, reinforcing its status as a resilient emblem of the city.
        
        The statue encapsulates the Belgian spirit of self-deprecation and humor, and it is surrounded by numerous legends explaining its origins. One popular story suggests that the statue commemorates a young boy who extinguished a fire threatening the city by urinating on it. Today, Manneken Pis not only draws tourists from around the world but also serves as a focal point for various local celebrations and events.</p>
