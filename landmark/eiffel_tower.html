        <p>The Eiffel Tower, an iconic symbol of France, stands tall in the heart of Paris. Constructed for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair marking the centennial celebration of the French Revolution, the tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel's engineering company. Originally criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, the Eiffel Tower has become one of the most recognized structures in the world. It is 324 meters tall and was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930.

        </p>This architectural feat was initially intended to be dismantled after 20 years, but it was saved due to its usefulness as a radiotelegraph station. Today, the Eiffel Tower attracts millions of visitors each year, making it one of the most visited paid monuments in the world. Visitors can ascend by stairs or elevators to its three levels, which house restaurants and observation decks that offer sweeping views of Paris. At night, the Eiffel Tower is illuminated by 20,000 light bulbs, making it a breathtaking sight and a beacon in the Parisian landscape.</p>
